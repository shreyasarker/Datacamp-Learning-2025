    "# Merging multiple DataFrames  \n",
    "\n",
    "Merging tables is an important step in combining data from different sources to answer complex questions. In earlier lessons, we looked at merging two tables with a one-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, however, the analysis requires more than two tables to be merged together. This helps bring in additional information and allows for deeper insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with multiple tables, it is often necessary to carefully choose the columns on which to merge. Using only one column may lead to unwanted matches, so combining multiple columns can help ensure that the data aligns correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The merge method in pandas allows us to specify multiple columns at once by passing a list of column names. In such cases, rows will only be matched if all specified columns have the same values in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond merging two tables, we can continue to add more. After performing the first merge, we can merge the result with another table, repeating the process as many times as needed. This way, information from different sources can be brought together into a single DataFrame for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, once all tables are merged, the combined dataset can be used to perform calculations, summaries, or visualizations. While three tables are often enough in many cases, pandas supports merging even more if the analysis requires it."
