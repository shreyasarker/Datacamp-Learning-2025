    "# Left Join\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we focus on the concept of a **left join**, another method of combining two tables. Before diving in, let’s recall what we already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we learned about the `merge` method in pandas, which combines two tables using one or more key columns. By default, this method performs an **inner join**, meaning it only returns rows where the key values are present in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **left join** works differently. It returns **all the rows from the left table**, and only the matching rows from the right table based on the key columns. If a value in the left table does not have a corresponding match in the right table, the left table’s data is still included, but the missing fields from the right table are filled with null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important distinction because a left join ensures that no data from the left table is excluded, even when no match exists in the right table. This feature makes left joins particularly useful when the left dataset is the main source of information and you want to enrich it with details from another table without losing any original rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing a left join, pandas requires the `how='left'` argument in the merge function. The default setting is `how='inner'`, which is why it wasn’t necessary to specify this earlier when we worked only with inner joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing a left join, the number of rows in the resulting table will always be equal to the number of rows in the left table, assuming a one-to-one relationship. This consistency ensures that the left table’s data remains fully intact while supplementing it with additional information where available.\n"
