# 🧠 DataCamp Learning Journey – 2025

Welcome to my personal learning repository where I document my progress through DataCamp courses in 2025. This space contains my:

- 📝 Notes & summaries & Practice code    
- 📄 Certificates  

## 🌟 Why I'm doing this:
I want to deepen my understanding of data science and Python, stay accountable, and build a visible learning portfolio.  
By sharing my progress publicly, I also hope to inspire others who are on a similar journey.
