# 🧠 DataCamp Learning Journey – 2025

Welcome to my personal learning repository where I document my progress through DataCamp courses in 2025. This space contains my:

- 📝 Notes & summaries  
- 🧪 Practice code  
- 📊 Mini-projects  
- 📄 Certificates  

## 🌟 Why I'm doing this:
I want to deepen my understanding of data science and Python, stay accountable, and build a visible learning portfolio.  
By sharing my progress publicly, I also hope to inspire others who are on a similar journey.

## 📁 Folder Structure

00-certificates/ ← All my course completion certificates

Each course folder contains:
- `notes.md` – A summary of what I learned  
- `practice-code.py` – Code snippets & experiments  
- `mini-project.ipynb` – Small hands-on project or challenge  
- `README.md` – Overview of that course module
