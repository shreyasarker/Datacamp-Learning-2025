# ðŸ“˜ Data Manipulation with pandas

## ðŸ“– Description

pandas is the world's most popular Python library, used for everything from data manipulation to data analysis. In this course, you'll learn how to manipulate DataFrames, as you extract, filter, and transform real-world datasets for analysis. Using pandas youâ€™ll explore all the core data science concepts. Using real-world data, including Walmart sales figures and global temperature time series, youâ€™ll learn how to import, clean, calculate statistics, and create visualizationsâ€”using pandas to add to the power of Python!
