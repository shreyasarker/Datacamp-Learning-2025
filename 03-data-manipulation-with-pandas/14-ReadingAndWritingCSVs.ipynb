    "# Summary: Reading and writing CSVs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Data Efficiently\n",
    "Instead of manually entering data into a DataFrame, you can efficiently load data from external files like CSVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding CSV Files\n",
    "CSV (comma-separated values) files are a common format for storing tabular data. Each line represents a row, and each value within a row is separated by a comma. CSVs are widely supported across databases, programming languages, and data analysis tools, making them ideal for sharing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading CSVs into DataFrames\n",
    "You can easily read data from a CSV into a pandas DataFrame using a built-in function that takes the file path as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manipulating Imported Data\n",
    "Once the data is in a DataFrame, you can use pandas functions to manipulate or enhance it, such as adding new calculated columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exporting Data to CSV\n",
    "After modifying a DataFrame, you can save it back to a CSV file to share or store the updated data using a pandas function that writes the DataFrame to a specified file path.\n"
